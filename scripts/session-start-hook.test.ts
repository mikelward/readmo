// The hook exists to stop web sessions running on a different Node major than
// CI and the deployed build. Its failure mode is a FALSE PASS — the suite goes green on the
// wrong runtime — so a broken hook is invisible without a test that asserts on
// which toolchain actually gets selected. It has already regressed once: the
// original existence-only cache check pinned the first version ever installed.
//
// The hook takes two test seams, SESSION_NODE_ROOT and SESSION_NODE_DIST_URL,
// so these cases run against a temp install root and a file:// release fixture
// instead of /opt and nodejs.org.
//
// Nothing here touches the network — but that holds only because every path the
// hook can take is redirected somewhere harmless. These cases run the WHOLE
// script, so the Deno section after the Node block counts too: HOME and
// DENO_INSTALL point into the fixture and a fake Deno reports the expected
// version, or the first case downloads ~40MB from GitHub into the developer's
// real ~/.deno. When you add a step to the hook, check whether it needs a seam
// here before assuming this file is still offline-safe.
