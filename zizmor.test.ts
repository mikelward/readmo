// Tests for the advisory zizmor scan: the workflow that runs it and the
// policy it loads.
//
// The scan's failure modes are all silent: a dropped version pin floats the
// audit set, so a verdict can change with no change in this repository; a
// dropped --offline puts the GitHub API inside the scan; a widened policy
// exempts refs nobody decided to exempt; a reintroduced path filter stops
// the scan from ever reporting on a PR that doesn't touch .github/**, which
// would leave a future required check pending forever (TODO.md, "Make
// `zizmor` a required check"). Every one of those leaves the rest of the
// suite green, because zizmor only runs inside its own workflow — so the
// contract is pinned here. Read with regexes like the engine repositories'
// own suites: no YAML parser, on purpose. Ported from mikelward/codex-
// review's own zizmor.test.js.
