# Readmo — Contributor guide

Readmo is a mobile-first RSS/Atom/JSON-feed reader PWA (React + TypeScript +
Vite, Supabase backend). It reuses *newshacker*'s UX as-is; the only intended
differences are the data source (your subscriptions, not Hacker News) and the
plumbing that requires (server-side fetch/parse + accounts + sync). The
normative product spec is [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md). These are the load-bearing
guardrails — read them before opening a PR.

## Guardrails

1. **Always add tests; always run them before reporting done.** Run
   `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` on every change, and
   `npm run build` when you touch build, routing, or deploy config. Fix a red
   baseline first, on its own commit. 80% coverage floor for `src/lib/` and
   server handlers.

2. **Fewer, larger tap targets.** At most **3 tap zones per row, two shipped**
   (row-body stretched link + right-side icon button; the middle slot stays
   reserved). **44×44px** touch floor on every interactive control, **≥8px
   gaps**, pressed-state on every zone. Flag anything that adds a fourth
   tappable or fills the reserved slot.

3. **US English everywhere** — copy, identifiers, CSS class names, DB column
   names, comments, docs (*favorite*, *color*, not *favourite*/*colour*).

4. **Keep `SPEC.md` in sync with reality.** Update it in the *same commit* as
   any reversed/extended decision or any new user-visible behavior, tap
   target, storage surface, route, or layout reorder.

5. **Call out cost and reliability up front** for any new infra or external
   call — free-tier vs. paid, rough $/mo, failure modes, rate limits, latency.
   Say "negligible" explicitly rather than omitting it.

6. **Treat all publisher content and user-supplied URLs as untrusted.**
   - **Sanitize every piece of publisher HTML server-side** (strip
     scripts/handlers/disallowed tags, absolutize relative URLs, force
     `rel="noopener"`) before storing. Never store or serve raw publisher HTML.
   - **Route every server-side fetch through the SSRF-hardened helper**
     (`/api/discover`, the poller, the image proxy, any future full-text
     fetch): scheme allow-list (http/https only), resolved-IP denylist
     (loopback, link-local incl. `169.254.169.254`, RFC1918, ULA, reserved),
     re-validate every redirect, timeouts + size caps, no credential
     forwarding. A unit test asserts it rejects loopback/link-local/private/
     metadata targets and redirects to them.

7. **RLS is the per-user boundary.** Every per-user table
   (`subscriptions`, `item_state`, `folders`) is gated on `auth.uid()`; fail
   closed. The **client never receives the service-role key** (poller only).
   `feeds`/`items` are physically shared but **not world-readable** — a row is
   exposed only when the caller has a matching `subscriptions` row *or* a
   permanent (`pinned`/`favorite`/`done`) `item_state` row pointing at it.
   Keep secret/tokenized feed URLs (`secret_url`) server-only.

8. **Scope client caches by `auth.uid()` and purge on account change.** Key the
   IndexedDB store and every Workbox runtime cache by the signed-in user; on
   any auth transition (sign-out, or sign-in as a different subject) purge the
   previous user's store + named caches before the new session paints. Never
   leak one user's cached/private content to the next on a shared device.

9. **Match newshacker's UX by default.** When in doubt about an interaction, do
   what newshacker does. Diverge only for the documented RSS-specific reasons:
   no comments/votes, server-side data, accounts/sync.

10. **Branching:** one topic per `claude/<short-topic>` branch off `main`; one
    commit per logical surviving change; PRs ready for review.

## Project layout

```
src/
  components/    shared UI components (rows, toolbars, action bars, chips)
  hooks/         React hooks (item state, swipe, online status, …)
  lib/           pure logic + utilities (theme, formatting, types)
  lib/data/      the data-access abstraction:
                   DataSource.ts     — the DataSource interface (the seam)
                   MockDataSource.ts — in-memory impl used today + in tests
                   context.tsx       — React context/provider for the source
                   seed.ts           — seed/fixture data for the mock
  pages/         route-level views (feed, library, reader, settings, signin)
  styles/        global.css with the --rm-* design tokens
  types/         ambient/build type declarations
public/          PWA icons + manifest assets (generated; see below)
scripts/         dev one-shots (generate-icons.mjs)
supabase/        Postgres migrations + Edge Functions (poller, discover,
                 SSRF helper, feed parser, sanitizer) and their fixtures
```

The data layer is abstracted behind **`src/lib/data/DataSource.ts`**.
`MockDataSource` backs it today; a `SupabaseDataSource` replaces it later
without touching callers — build features against the interface, not a concrete
source.

## Dev commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server (service worker disabled) |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -b` typecheck + `vite build` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build |
| `npm test` | `vitest run` (one shot) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the repo |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc -b --noEmit` |
| `npm run icons:generate` | Regenerate `public/` icons (`node scripts/generate-icons.mjs`) |

Run `lint`, `typecheck`, and `test` before every PR; add `build` when you touch
build/routing/deploy.
