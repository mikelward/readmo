#   - Node dependencies (vitest / eslint / tsc / vite)

#   - The Edge Functions' npm deps in Deno's own cache (@mozilla/readability,
#     linkedom, sanitize-html, fast-xml-parser, entities) so `deno test` /
#     `deno check` on supabase/functions/* resolve offline instead of failing
#     mid-test with "module not found".

# network policy blocks (403). GitHub release assets are reachable, so we
# fetch the release archive from there instead.

# able to answer the moment the Node block runs.
INHERITED_PATH="$PATH"

# Make a provisioned toolchain reach the rest of the session.
#
# $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE is the harness's own seam for this and is the right answer
# whenever it exists. It is not always set, though — it is unset in this
# sandbox today — and then the caller's `export` reaches only this hook and its
# children, so every later agent shell drops back to whatever the image ships.
# That is the silent-wrong-runtime failure this whole file exists to prevent:
# the suite goes green on the image's Node while CI and Vercel run the pinned
# one, and nothing says so.
#
# A shell rc file is NOT the fallback. The harness snapshots the environment at
# session start, before hooks run, so an rc edit lands one session late —
# verified by writing one and watching a later shell not see it. That failure
# looks exactly like success.
#
# So when there is no env file, change what the NAME resolves to instead of
# changing the environment: a symlink in a PATH directory that already precedes
# the image's own copy wins the lookup for every later shell, whatever that
# shell sources.
#
# Only directories under $HOME are eligible, which is both the safe rule and
# the honest one — the sandbox's first PATH entry is ~/.local/bin, a system
# directory is the image's business rather than ours, and it keeps this
# testable without a seam (the test redirects HOME and nothing real is
# touched).
#
# Usage: persist_on_path <bin-dir> <tool>...   Returns non-zero if it could not.

  shift

  # Every requested tool has to be RUNNABLE in the source, checked before
  # EITHER persistence route runs. Both routes put the whole of $bin_dir ahead
  # of the image's copies, so a missing or non-executable npm there means later
  # shells pair the provisioned node with the image's npm — the split this
  # function exists to prevent, and a stale link from an earlier major left
  # beside a fresh one is the same thing wearing the right name. `-x` rather
  # than `-e` because command lookup skips a non-executable file and falls
  # through, so "present" is not the question — and `-f` alongside it because
  # `-x` is true of a DIRECTORY (they are searchable), which lookup skips just
  # the same.
  #
  # The mode bits are necessary and not sufficient: a regular executable file
  # can still fail to start — a missing interpreter, a truncated or wrong-arch
  # binary — and the links outlive this session while the failure surfaces only
  # in the hook's own `npm install`. So runnability is asked by RUNNING it. That
  # adds no execution the session doesn't already do: the provisioned node has
  # been probed before we get here, and `npm install` runs this very npm seconds
  # later. It only moves the question ahead of the part that persists.
  # `--version` is the one flag node, npm, npx and deno all answer; the cost is
  # one process per tool, about a second, once per session.

# --- Node toolchain ---------------------------------------------------------
# The repo pins a Node major in .nvmrc, and package.json `engines` narrows to
# that same major — capped rather than open-ended on purpose, because moving
# the major is a runtime migration that has to move every pin at once, not a
# dependency bump. nodeVersion.test fails CI if the two ever disagree.
# The web sandbox ships its own default Node, which will not track that pin —
# so provision the pinned major and put it first on PATH.
#
# This matters beyond tidiness: without it, npm install/test/build silently run
# on a different major than CI (actions/setup-node reads the same .nvmrc) and
# Vercel (which reads `engines`). npm also emits EBADENGINE once the sandbox
# default falls outside the range. Reading the major from .nvmrc rather than
# hard-coding it means the next LTS bump needs no change here.
#
# Cost and reliability (AGENTS.md rule 11). Both requests below go to
# nodejs.org, which is free and unmetered with no account, tier, or key — so the
# project cost is $0/month at any session volume, with no paid threshold to
# cross. Per session that is one ~200 KB release-index GET; the ~50 MB tarball
# is fetched only when the cache is cold or the pinned version moved, so it is
# roughly once per container rather than once per session.
# Reliability: this adds nodejs.org as a new dependency of session startup, and
# it is on the critical path now that the hook is synchronous. Mitigated by
# failing open — an unreachable index or a failed download keeps the cached
# toolchain (or the system one) and logs a warning rather than aborting the
# session — so the worst case is a session that starts on a stale runtime and
# says so, not one that cannot start. Nothing here touches the app's runtime or
# production path; it is developer tooling only.

# SESSION_NODE_ROOT and SESSION_NODE_DIST_URL exist so the provisioning
# branches below can be exercised by scripts/session-start-hook.test.ts against

# --- Edge Function npm deps (Deno's cache) --------------------------------
# The Supabase Edge Functions import npm packages (@mozilla/readability,
# linkedom, sanitize-html, fast-xml-parser, entities) via the import map. The
# `npm install` above only populates node_modules for the Node/Vitest side;
# Deno keeps a *separate* module cache, so without this step a `deno test` or
# `deno check` over supabase/functions/* tries to reach the network mid-run and
# fails with "module not found" (e.g. @mozilla/readability). Pre-fetch them so
# the edge checks run offline.
#
# We deliberately cache the pure _shared logic modules, not the function
# entrypoints: the entrypoints import @supabase/supabase-js from jsr.io, which
# the sandbox network policy blocks (403). These four modules pull every mapped
# npm package from the (reachable) npm registry between them. Best-effort: a
# registry hiccup shouldn't abort session startup.
