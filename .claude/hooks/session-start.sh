#   - Node dependencies (vitest / eslint / tsc / vite)
#   - Deno, the Supabase Edge Functions runtime (supabase/functions/*)
#   - The Edge Functions' npm deps in Deno's own cache (@mozilla/readability,
#     linkedom, sanitize-html, fast-xml-parser, entities) so `deno test` /
#     `deno check` on supabase/functions/* resolve offline instead of failing
#     mid-test with "module not found".
#
# Deno's official installer downloads from dl.deno.land, which the sandbox
# network policy blocks (403). GitHub release assets are reachable, so we
# fetch the release archive from there instead.

# --- Node toolchain ---------------------------------------------------------
# The repo pins a Node major in .nvmrc, and package.json `engines` narrows to
# that same major — capped rather than open-ended on purpose, because moving
# the major is a runtime migration that has to move every pin at once, not a
# dependency bump. nodeVersion.test fails CI if the two ever disagree.
# The web sandbox ships its own default Node, which will not track that pin —
# so provision the pinned major and put it first on PATH.
#
# This matters beyond tidiness: without it, npm install/test/build silently run
# on a different major than CI (actions/setup-node reads the same .nvmrc) and
# Vercel (which reads `engines`). npm also emits EBADENGINE once the sandbox
# default falls outside the range. Reading the major from .nvmrc rather than
# hard-coding it means the next LTS bump needs no change here.
#
# Cost and reliability (AGENTS.md rule 11). Both requests below go to
# nodejs.org, which is free and unmetered with no account, tier, or key — so the
# project cost is $0/month at any session volume, with no paid threshold to
# cross. Per session that is one ~200 KB release-index GET; the ~50 MB tarball
# is fetched only when the cache is cold or the pinned version moved, so it is
# roughly once per container rather than once per session.
# Reliability: this adds nodejs.org as a new dependency of session startup, and
# it is on the critical path now that the hook is synchronous. Mitigated by
# failing open — an unreachable index or a failed download keeps the cached
# toolchain (or the system one) and logs a warning rather than aborting the
# session — so the worst case is a session that starts on a stale runtime and
# says so, not one that cannot start. Nothing here touches the app's runtime or
# production path; it is developer tooling only.
#
# SESSION_NODE_ROOT and SESSION_NODE_DIST_URL exist so the provisioning
# branches below can be exercised by scripts/session-start-hook.test.ts against
# a temp dir and a file:// fixture. They are test seams only — production never
# sets them. Named without a repo prefix because this hook is kept identical
# across readmo, newshacker and gedmap.
