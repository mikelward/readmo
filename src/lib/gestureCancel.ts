/**
 * "Something else has claimed this gesture — stand down."
 *
 * Broadcast on `window` when a multi-touch gesture takes over from a
 * single-pointer one. It exists because the two kinds of gesture in this app
 * don't share an event stream and can't see each other: the row swipe
 * (`useSwipeToDismiss`) and pull-to-refresh (`usePullToRefresh`) track *pointer*
 * events, while the pinch (`usePinchFontSize`) reads *touch* events, which is
 * the only API that reports two fingers at once.
 *
 * `preventDefault()` on a touch event does not reach across: it stops the page
 * scrolling and zooming, but the pointer stream keeps flowing, so a pinch that
 * starts on an article row leaves that row's swipe still tracking the first
 * finger. Spread the fingers horizontally and its eventual `pointerup` commits
 * Done or Pin — a destructive action the user never asked for, while they were
 * resizing text. The browser fires no `pointercancel` for this, because nothing
 * went wrong from its point of view.
 *
 * A window event rather than context so the pinch handler, which is mounted once
 * at the app root, doesn't have to know which rows exist or be threaded through
 * every list; the same shape the theme uses (`readmo:themeChanged`).

export const GESTURE_CANCEL_EVENT = 'readmo:gestureCancel';

/**
 * The half of standing down that no subscriber can do for itself: swallowing
 * the click a finger still resting on a control will fire when it lifts.
 *
 * Subscribing works for a gesture that owns state (the swipe, the pull, the
 * reorder drag). It does not work for *activation*, because there is no one
 * place that activates: `TooltipButton` is one of many, and Sign out, the feed
 * import/export controls and others are plain `<button>`s that will never
 * subscribe to anything. Asking each to opt in leaves the next one written
 * without it — and the failure is a destructive action (signing the user out,
 * marking an article Done) taken while they were only resizing text.
 *
 * So this is a capture-phase swallow at the document, armed by the broadcast
 * and disarmed by the next `pointerdown`: a fresh press is a new intention, so
 * anything the pinch interrupted is over by then. It cannot strand a control —
 * every real pointer click is preceded by the `pointerdown` that disarms it —
 * and it leaves keyboard activation (`detail === 0`) alone, which has no
 * pointer behind it and so can never be the tail of an abandoned gesture.
