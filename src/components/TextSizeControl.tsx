 * Text-size stepper: smaller / current / larger.
 *
 * It replaced a segmented row of one button per rung, which stopped working as
 * the ladder grew past 24px. Thirteen rungs is a lot of tap targets for one
 * setting, they no longer divide into the drawer's three columns, and the "A"
 * glyphs that gave the row its ramp are capped by the button height — so the
 * top four rungs all rendered at the same size and the ramp said nothing.
 *
 * A stepper costs random access: reaching the far end is several taps rather
 * than one. The pinch gesture is the fast path now, which is what makes that
 * trade affordable, and the stepper is the same shape as the gesture — step up,
 * step down — rather than a second, different mental model for the same ladder.
 * It also stops caring how long the ladder is, so adding a rung later is a
 * one-line change with no layout consequence.
 *
 * `onClick` stops propagation so using it inside the drawer (whose panel closes
 * on click) doesn't dismiss the drawer.
