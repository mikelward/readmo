// Inline-only markdown renderer for AI summary strings. Ported from newshacker
// (guardrail #9 — match newshacker's UX) where it renders Gemini article/comment
// summaries. Gemini's summaries are *informally* markdown — mostly plain text,
// but the model emits `code` and **bold** spans (and we now ask it to). Treating
// the strings as markdown is strictly a superset of treating them as plain text,
// so this component is safe to use anywhere a summary is rendered.
//
// Why not `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` + a markdown library: this tokenizer emits
// known JSX elements (<code>, <strong>, <em>) whose text content is a regex
// capture group dropped through React's normal `{…}` interpolation. React
// escapes that text by construction, so the worst-case output is "model included
// a literal `<script>` between backticks and the user sees the characters
// `<script>`" — never an injected tag. No new client dependency, no XSS surface.
//
// Asterisk italic (`*x*`) is handled too — Gemini leaks it the same way it leaks
// `**bold**`, and a stray literal `*` on either side of a phrase reads as noise.
// Three guards keep it from eating things that aren't emphasis:
//   - the content must begin and end with a "word" character (letter, digit, or
//     `_`), so a span can't open or close on whitespace (`3 * 4`) or on
//     path/glob punctuation (`src/*/*.ts`, `*.ts/*.tsx` — those start/end on `/`
//     or `.` and stay literal);
//   - each `*` must sit on a word boundary on the *outside* too (checked in JS
//     below), so compact formulas/identifiers like `2*3*4` or `foo*bar*baz` stay
//     literal instead of italicizing their middle term.
// The word classes use Unicode property escapes so accented / non-Latin emphasis
// (`*café*`, `*日本語*`) still italicizes. Underscore italic (`_x_`) is out of
// scope — it collides with `snake_case` identifiers.
//
// Out of scope by design: underscore italic (see above), links (model-supplied
// URLs are a different trust story), and any block-level construct. The summary
// prompt asks for a flowing short paragraph with no headings/lists, so inline
// coverage is enough.

// Every alternative is inline-only: the inner class explicitly excludes `\n`, so
// a stray `**` at the start of one paragraph can't bold every character through
// to a `**` several lines down.
const CODE = /`([^`\n]+)`/.source;
const BOLD = /\*\*([^*\n][^\n]*?)\*\*/.source;
// A letter, digit, or underscore in any script — the "word" character the italic
// edges and the outer-boundary guard below both key off.
const WORD_CHAR = '[\\p{L}\\p{N}_]';
// Tried after BOLD, so `**x**` is consumed as bold before this can see it.
// Content begins and ends with WORD_CHAR (everything between is just "not a `*`
// or newline"). The outer-boundary check is done in JS below, NOT with a regex
// lookbehind: `(?<!…)` is a parse-time SyntaxError on Safari < 16.4, and this is
// a mobile-facing app with no transpile step that would rewrite it — a bad
// lookbehind doesn't fail one match, it stops the module from loading.
const ITALIC = `\\*(${WORD_CHAR}(?:[^*\\n]*${WORD_CHAR})?)\\*`;
const TOKEN_RE = new RegExp(`${CODE}|${BOLD}|${ITALIC}`, 'gu');

// A `*` is an emphasis delimiter only when its outer neighbor is a boundary
// (string edge, whitespace, or punctuation) rather than a word character.
const WORD = new RegExp(WORD_CHAR, 'u');
