// Renovate is deliberately unscheduled and in full mode: it may open a PR the
// moment an update clears its minimumReleaseAge cooldown, instead of waiting
// for a weekly window. Every failure mode here is silent — a bot that opens
// nothing looks exactly like a repo with nothing to update, which is how this
// config sat inert from July 12 with zero PRs and zero dashboard issue.
//
//  - reintroducing a `schedule` string parks every cooled-down update until the
//    next window, so a security patch that cleared its cooldown on Sunday sits
//    for six days;
//  - DELETING `lockFileMaintenance.schedule` does not mean "any time" — that
//    option's Renovate default is `before 4am on monday`, so dropping the key
//    silently restores a weekly window rather than removing one;
//  - `mode` defaults to "full" in Renovate itself, but the Mend-hosted app
//    defaults an "All repositories" install to "silent", which suppresses PRs
//    AND the dependency dashboard. Stating it here is the repo-side half of
//    that override; the Mend UI setting is the other half and can't be tested.
//
// "at any time" is Renovate's own spelling for an unrestricted schedule; a
// typo'd variant is rejected by the schema, not silently ignored.

// Grouping keeps peer-related packages in one PR, and a hole in it is silent
// in the same way the schedule settings are: the update still lands, just as
// its own PR, so you only notice by recognizing a name that should have
// traveled with its family. `@eslint/js` did exactly that (13012d8) because
// the eslint group matched `eslint-**` but not `@eslint/**`.
//
// Asserting the *patterns* would only catch deletion, not the likelier
// mistake — a pattern that no longer matches anything: a typo'd scope, a
// renamed package, a newly added plugin nobody grouped. So these resolve every
// real dependency in package.json through the rules and assert where each one
// lands.
//
// `@fontsource**` was exactly that and went unnoticed until the fonts family
// was added below: it matched none of the five installed fontsource packages,
// because minimatch only treats `**` as a cross-directory globstar when it is a
// whole path segment. Every family the config claims to group belongs in the
// table below — a group with no case here is a group nothing is checking.

// Renovate matches package names with minimatch glob semantics, so this uses

//
// Two hand-rolled attempts both got it wrong, in opposite directions, and each
// time the *test* was the thing that lied: first `*` was modeled as crossing a
// path separator (so the guard would have failed a config Renovate accepts),
// then `**` was modeled as always crossing one (so the guard reported that
// `@fontsource**` matched `@fontsource-variable/inter`, which it does not —
// minimatch treats `**` as a globstar only when it is a whole path segment, and
// an embedded one behaves like `*`). That second error would have blessed a
// rule matching nothing.
//
// A regex approximation of minimatch is exactly the kind of thing that looks
// right until it silently disagrees on one pattern, which is the failure mode
// this whole file exists to catch — so the real implementation is the ground
// truth here, and `minimatch` is a declared devDependency for that reason.

// The rules above are only worth having if they actually fire, and a rule that

//
//  - `lockFileMaintenance` used to sit in the same rule as
//    `matchCurrentVersion: "!/^0/"`. A lockFileMaintenance branch refreshes the
//    whole lockfile and has no single dependency behind it, so currentVersion
//    is null and Renovate skips any rule carrying that predicate — those PRs
//    silently never auto-merged.
//  - the github-actions rule used to repeat `minimumReleaseAge: "7 days"`.
//    Being the last matching rule, that overwrote the 14-day major cooldown for
//    actions majors, quietly halving it.
//
// Both are last-wins accidents, so the assertions below resolve a query the way
// Renovate does rather than inspecting rules individually.
