// Renovate is DISABLED for this repo. `enabled: false` at the top of
// renovate.json is the master switch, and the first assertion below is the only
// one that gates live behavior today. Everything after it describes config that
// is dormant but retained — kept so that re-enabling is deleting one key rather
// than rebuilding a config that took several rounds to get right, and asserted
// so the dormant half can't rot into something that misbehaves the moment it is
// switched back on.
//
// Renovate is deliberately unscheduled and in full mode: it may open a PR the
// moment an update clears its minimumReleaseAge cooldown, instead of waiting
// for a weekly window. Every failure mode here is silent — a bot that opens
// nothing looks exactly like a repo with nothing to update, which is how this
// config sat inert from July 12 with zero PRs and zero dashboard issue.
//
//  - reintroducing a `schedule` string parks every cooled-down update until the
//    next window, so a security patch that cleared its cooldown on Sunday sits
//    for six days;
//  - DELETING `lockFileMaintenance.schedule` does not mean "any time" — that
//    option's Renovate default is `before 4am on monday`, so dropping the key
//    silently restores a weekly window rather than removing one;
//  - `mode` defaults to "full" in Renovate itself, but the Mend-hosted app
//    defaults an "All repositories" install to "silent", which suppresses PRs
//    AND the dependency dashboard. Stating it here is the repo-side half of
//    that override; the Mend UI setting is the other half and can't be tested.
//
// "at any time" is Renovate's own spelling for an unrestricted schedule; a
// typo'd variant is rejected by the schema, not silently ignored.

// Grouping keeps peer-related packages in one PR, and a hole in it is silent

// real dependency in package.json through the rules and assert where each one
// lands.
//
// `@fontsource**` was exactly that and went unnoticed until the fonts family
// was added below: it matched none of the five installed fontsource packages,

// minimatch treats `**` as a globstar only when it is a whole path segment, and

// rule matching nothing.
//
// A regex approximation of minimatch is exactly the kind of thing that looks

//  - `lockFileMaintenance` used to sit in the same rule as
//    `matchCurrentVersion: "!/^0/"`. A lockFileMaintenance branch refreshes the
//    whole lockfile and has no single dependency behind it, so currentVersion
//    is null and Renovate skips any rule carrying that predicate — those PRs

//  - the github-actions rule used to repeat `minimumReleaseAge: "7 days"`.
//    Being the last matching rule, that overwrote the 14-day major cooldown for
//    actions majors, quietly halving it.
//
// Both are last-wins accidents, so the assertions below resolve a query the way
// Renovate does rather than inspecting rules individually.

//  - the nvm manager kept re-offering `node` itself. `.nvmrc` holds a bare
//    major by design, Renovate's nvm manager can only write a full version,
//    and nodeVersion.test.ts asserts the bare major — so every Node patch
//    opened a PR that could not go green, in all three repos, forever. The
//    rules that stop that are worth exactly as much as the assertions below,
//    because a disable rule that stops matching looks identical to one that
